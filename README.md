## Rossmann Sales Prediction.

* Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.
* We are provided with historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores. 
* The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set. Note that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.

## Solution Strategy

* Step 01: Data Description: Use statistics metrics to identify data distribuctions.

* Step 02: Feature Engineering: Derive new attributes based on the original variables to better describe the phenomenon that will be modeled.

* Step 03: Exploratory Data Analysis: Explore the data to find insights and better understand the impact of variables on model learning.

* Step 04: Feature Selection: Selection of the most significant attributes for training the model.

* Step 05: Machine Learning Modelling: Machine Learning model training.

* Step 06: Hyperparameter Fine Tunning: hoose the best values for each of the parameters of the model selected from the previous step.
